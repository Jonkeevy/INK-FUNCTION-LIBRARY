>>>>>>>> VAR SORTERS <<<<<<<<<<<<<
Because VARs cannot be passed from a filter function, changing them requires switch statements.
I call these Switch statements SORTERS as they 'sort' the effect to the correct VAR.
SORTERs cannot be generalised beyond their structure.
Therefore all sorters are project specific and kept with the rest of the project files.
They should be appended with _PROJECTINITIALS
