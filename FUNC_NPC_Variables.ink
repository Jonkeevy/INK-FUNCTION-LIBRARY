// ............ LISTS .......................
// Ink Lists are funky, it took me a bit to figure out how NOT to use them. They don't work exactly like things called lists in any other language. The documentation attempts to explain Lists in digestible mouthfuls, but only gives the clear summary at the end of the chapter. So if you want to get you head around Lists, start at the end and then go to the beginning.

//LIST mission_States = unknown, active, completed, declined

//LIST gig_states = performed, booked, cancelled
